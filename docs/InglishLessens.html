<pre class="poem-text">A man with hair on his teeth,
was unlucky to break his two feet,
now he runs on his hands,
with his head in his pants,
and they all find he looks so sweet.

In winter it was very glad,
I slipped out and I lost my hat,
the milkman passed,
with a quick-step fast,
and he laughed but he felt self flat.

A man named Patrice,
was fond of ice,
but where he lived very hot it was,
and the ice melted quick,
he became the hick,
cause he was afraid to drown in the plass.

A certain Kasavoeboe
was visiting Honoloeloe
and he danced the Hoelahoep
with the Baloebatroep
while the Hawaian girls said I love yoe.

A ladykiller named Bill
was lucky when he could kill
then he pushed his knife
in his victims life
till it was calm and still.

A man who was known as a drinker
forgot to switch on his pinker
and he bumped into me
I fell on my knee
and I made him out for a stinker.

A black, a yellow and a white
were talking quiet
about a red one,
their discussing was strong
in large and in long
and they said that he was the wrong man.

Three little bulls were running fast,
the first, the second and the last,
They stopped and turned around,
ran with their heads to the ground,
The last, the second and the firsty,
they ran, cause they were thirsty.
